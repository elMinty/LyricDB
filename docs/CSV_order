And how do  I sound like  I be in my prime still? If nobody don't wanna rep grime then  I will Waving the flag for every one of us who came through the back door For the peeping  Toms with no insight, we ain't singing this song till we go inside I'm just tryna define longevity, don't tell me about charting How many people have charted and still couldn't avoid being a lost memory? I don't remember you, what was your song?  Ah, it don't even matter, don't even respond The label never made me, only a  Pagan can hate me Am  I wrong, insane?  I'm a self-made don?  Come on, rate me I ain't got a problem making an impact Tell  Flip and  Sketch, analyse all my lyrics in depth and then think back To when  I said  I ain't doing it for the sake of doing it, how many people have already did that? I just made it harder for myself, you would think that  I ain't aware my skin's black Wallace is dead but  I ain't forgot what he said, he said honestly To the truth, fuck that, don't matter anymore cause the game's based on dishonesty They're for the niggas that came from nothing and got their first stacks off a robbery Promise me, don't ever come back to the roads cause there ain't nothing here for you Old school for a year or two, and it's only now manaman's hearing you Wallace, you were right my brother, but it just weren't over your skin Man are strapped like  Officer  Leng, nah,  I'm in a meeting, with the dream team( You know when  I come for the rooms like?) Disturbing the peace in the offices again Now, all these rhymes are constructed inside a mind that's corrupted( You know like, this is music in its purest form - it's shaping art) And now man's thinking about tracklisting, dividing and the substance Born and raised in a broken home but  I know my father good Times changed and he overdosed on this drug called fatherhood Man, could you pray for a man like me?  It's a living hell but  I'm far from good I know the  Lord forgives, and after what  I've done  I'm asking if he could Now  I'm living this rap star life, every nigga  I meet is on gas mark 9 If these words fall upon deaf ears,  I ain't even gonna rap part-time Fire burning in my soul, you can see it in my eyeballs They say  I ain't  Ghetto no more when  I hit em with lyrics as deep as the  Bible Rudeboy don't get it twisted,  I still party with the animals I'm getting money by any means necessary, who told you  I can't have it all? Rags, man are  Malcolm, man are proud when They see a man from out of town shut down, but not man around them I'm an  R- E- B- E- L, kicked out of school, ended up in  Felton But  I should've went UTL, now  I'm putting my life on i Tunes For all to hear, ain't nothing on the DL,  I am in another league,  I'm realPS, PRS, PPL,  Twitter - let me just go down my TL [ Outro] Oh look, everyone doubts me They don't know where  I'm coming from I've already broken boundaries They pushed me in deeper And they thought they would drown me I'm still here, they're like how come  I'm back?
